package wifi

// The wifi package provides TCP/IP based connection negotiation and establishes
// UDP/IP based connections for sending and receiving data to a device.
//
// Note that this package and the (partial) implementation of the ARDiscovery
// protocol found within is abbreviated as "wifi" for traceability to relevant
// sections of the Parrot developer documentation.
