package arnetworkal

// The arnetworkal package implements the ARNetworkAL protocol and is
// responsible for the network abstraction used by the arnetwork package.
//
// Two implementations of this abstraction are possible, with one being UDP/IP
// based (implemented) and the other being BLE (Bluetooth) based (currently not
// implemented).
//
// To help maintain traceability to relevant sections of the Parrot developer
// documentation, the UDP/IP based implementation of this abstraction will be
// abbreviated as "wifi".
//
// TODO: Create BLE based implementation.
